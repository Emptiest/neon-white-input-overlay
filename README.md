# neon-white-input-overlay
A set of preconfigured .json files for configuring the input overlay while playing Neon White

These are intended to be used with the 5.0 Pre release version of [input-overlay](https://github.com/univrsal/input-overlay). Follow their [instructions](https://github.com/univrsal/input-overlay/wiki/Usage), and when you get to select your overlay image and config file, pick the ones from this repo!

## Examples

(Note: The overlays themselves are actually transparent)
